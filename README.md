# Third-Person-Shooter
(WIP) A third person shooter made with Unreal Engine 4. ~~All scripts are written in Blueprints.~~ This project originally contained only Blueprints. However, since some functions cannot be seen and overridden in Blueprints, and I may need to improve performance in the future, I had to convert the project into a C++ project.
This project requires Unreal Engine 4.22. If you want to upgrade the project to the latest version of Unreal Engine 4, you may have to change the source code.

TODO:
  + AI:
    - Make the NPCs alert when they get hurt by a projectile, or when an enemy touches them.
    - Prevent the NPCs from shooting at walls.
  + Decal:
    - Fix the bullet holes not apprearing on a character when it is shot.
  + Gameplay:
    - Create blueprints for doors, moving platforms, and launchpads.
  + Animation:
    - Improve melee animation.
  + Input:
    - Fix the mouse input not working properly in the standalone game.
